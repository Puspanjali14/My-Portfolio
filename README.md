Hello, my name is Puspanjali Neupane, and this is my personal portfolio website.
I created this portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills as a frontend developer and web designer.
Design and Structure:
HTML: I structured my website with semantic HTML tags to make it accessible and easy to navigate. 
Each section is clearly defined, from the header and navigation menu to the main content and footer.

CSS: I styled the website with custom CSS to create a visually appealing layout.
My design includes a clean color palette, modern fonts, and responsive design to ensure that the site looks great on all devices.

JavaScript: I added interactivity using JavaScript. Features like smooth scrolling, animations, and dynamic elements make the user experience more engaging.
